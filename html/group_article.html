      <br>
      <br>

      <p>
        Have you ever wondered how our modern society came to be? Well it does not really matter, you have still arrived at the perfect website. The Renaissance began in Italy and rapidly spread throughout Europe in the 16th century, an era of many reforming eye-opening new discoveries. It all started when people criticized the restricted and hypocritical catholic church. The German monk Martin Luther, took advantage of the new art of printing to help publish and disperse the 95 theses, and also stated that wealthier individuals should not have the possibility to buy themselves a “ticket to heaven” through the sales of indulgences.
        <br><br>
        This incident came to be known as the Reformation and it started a new mindset which did not allow belief and religion to have an influence on politics. In short the Renaissance is the French word for rebirth. This word was used to coin an era in European history known as The Renaissance that ranged from the 14th-17th century, characterized by profound revolutionary reforms in societal norms, morals and values. Furthermore this period was signified by the shift of paradigms that permeated in science, religion, economy, culture, legislation and society.

      <p> William Shakespeare is recognized as one of the world's greatest play writers. He was born in a small town called Stratford-upon-Avon located in the northwest of London. He got married at the age of 18 and later started his own family. At the age of 25, he moved to London to work as an actor and also wrote his first plays.

      <h4 class="authors"> Christopher Marlowe </h4>
      <p> Christopher Marlowe was a poet and a playwright at the end of the Renaissance in the 16th century. His work influenced several printers such as William Shakespeare and others.
        <br>
        Marlowe was born in 1564 in Canterbury, England and died on February 26, 1593, as a 29-year-old when he was murdered.  Unfortunately, Marlowe's literary career lasted less than 6 years. Nevertheless, he was one of the first English dramatists to show the full potential of using dramatic ballads, as well as the first one to use the miserable consequences of Humanism in the Renaissance.
        <br>
        It is believed that the wrote between 4 and 7 works and one of the most famous work is "The Jew of Malta", "Edward the Second" and "The Massacre at Paris".

      <h3> William Shakespeare </h3>
      <br>
      <p> William Shakespeare was baptized in April 26th in the year 1564. He was born in England, Stratford-upon-Avon. William Shakespeare was an actor, writer and poet. William Shakespeare is always called the best poet or writer and the greatest dramatist in English history. He did not like to share his personal life even if all his plays are known all over the world. Shakespeare wrote 34 play 2 long poems and 154 sonnets. You have probably heard about at least one of his work the most common one is Romeo and Juliet. Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare early in his career about two young lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their families who hate each other. There is not a lot of information him.
        <br>
        <br>

        Shakespeare's life can only be described from two sources and they do not really give a good picture of his life, rather an overview of his life.
        <br>
        The first source is his work, like plays, sonnets, poems and such as. The second source are documents written by the church and such as but the only talks about main events in his life. No one even knows when he was actually born all we have is a few church documents that tell us when he was baptized. William Shakespeare was the 3rd child of John Shakespeare who was a leather merchant. His father was a pretty successful merchant who had a high status. William Shakespeare is an important person because he has contributed a lot to the English language.

      <h3> Analysis of Shakespeare's <i> Hamlet </i> </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Hamlet is a play written by Shakespeare at the end of the renaissance. Hamlet is one of his most famous works and it has been performed since its release in 1609. The play is about love, murder, revenge and moral within the Danish royalty. The King of Denmark is murdered by his brother, the son of the dead King then returns from England to get revenge.
        <br>
        <br>
        Shakespeare has a debate about moral in the play while creating an incredible story that the audience loves. He tries to show us how punishment always come for the sinners but also that revenge may not be the way to punish thus you have now sinned yourself. At the end of the play all the main characters dies, including the prince who came for revenge.
        <br>
        <br>
        Hamlet was written during a time in England where the King or Queen had all the power and their word was law. This means you could not express all opinions of the monarch, yet Shakespeare wrote this play about infidelity and murder using another monarch family. This could have been a way for him to create the idea that the rulers are not perfect, that they are just people.
        <br>
        <br>
        To me, humanism influenced Shakespeare’s work quite a lot. In Hamlet an example of that would be the way he writes about strong human emotions and puts them in the center of the play. He creates all these characters with different relationships to each other as well as different hardships. For example, the son who comes for revenge is in love with a girl, his goal is to kill his father's murderer, which would be his lovers father. There are so many strong feelings in the play, they are exaggerated but in a way very relatable for many. This is why William Shakespeare and his work has lived for so long and will live forever.
