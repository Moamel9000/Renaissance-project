<p>
   In European history, the Renaissance is one of the most interesting and controversial periods of all time.
   Around 1350, the Renaissance began in Italy and spread to the rest of Europe after the middle of the 15th century. The epic period was preserved until the 1620s. It was a glowing period of European culture that emerged from artistic, literature, a political, social, musical, and economic rebirth that came after the Middle Ages.
</p>

<br>

<p>
   Rebirth was another term used to describe the Renaissance of intellectual Italians. It was because arts, learning, and literature were reborn after the long and dark Middle Ages, admiring the ancient world of Rome and Greece. The Italians suggested that hundreds of years of cultural darkness were due to the fact that much of the ancient world of learning and literature had gone astray, this cultural darkness occurred in the Middle Ages. The concept of “Middle Ages” was created by Italian humanists to describe the period between 400 and 14th century AD.
</p>

<br>

<p>
   Northern Europe also began to accept that a new age had emerged after the 17th century, as well as the chronological division of ancientness, the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. To achieve this, the dutchman Desiderius Erasmus and his followers turned to two ancient sources: the secular learning of ancient Greece and Rome's first four centuries of Christianity. (Erasmus, 1466-1536, was a humanist who attempted to unite the Christian faith with the ancient world)
</p>

<br>

<p>
   They turned to Christianity during that period because Christianity during that time offered good literature, culture, and good morals. While the New Testament and Church Fathers as Sts. Augustine and Jerome mixed original Christianity with ancient rhetoric.
   The problem was the barbaric medieval culture that replaced the old rhetoric. Erasmus and his followers devoted their time to restoring good literature, which meant classical Greek and Latin, and good religion. This led to Christianity being cleaned of medieval philosophical irrelevance and priestly abuse.
</p>

<br>

<p>
    The French historians Jacob Burckhardt and Jules Michelet mean that during the 14th and 15th centuries people began to discover themselves and the world that was outside.
    The typical Renaissance man was a person who questioned himself and followed his own dreams and desires. This led to a burning desire to explore the world, through art, travel and world trade. In this way, Western culture took off and left the oriental and other cultures in the development.

<p>
  There are several important key persons during that time. But the humanistic and popular writer Petrarch is considered to be one of the first important key persons because he strongly criticized the medieval lifestyle. There were several intellectual Italians who supported the Petrarch purpose in the 1400-1450s on a rebirth of ancient culture and the first four centuries of Christianity to be adapted to their new society.
</p>

<br>

<p>
  From this, humanism was created, which in the end would dominate Italian Latin schools, ethical ideas and spread to the rest of Europe at the end of the 15th and early 16th century. Monarchies such as Spain, France, and England emerged as powerful and their disputes between each other dominated European politics over the next 150 years. Finally, the spread of books created by Johannes Gutenberg was so great that one could not measure it. By the end of the 14th century, around twenty cities had printing presses, which were later increased to 255 cities in the 15th century. More books for the people influenced them both intellectually and religiously.
