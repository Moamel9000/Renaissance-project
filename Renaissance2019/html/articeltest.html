The Renaissance is one of the most interesting and controversial periods of European history.
Around 1350, the Renaissance began in Italy and spread to the rest of Europe after the middle of the 15th century. The epic period was preserved until the 1620s. It was a glowing period of European culture that emerged from artistic, literature, a political, social, musical, and economic rebirth that came after the Middle Ages.
Rebirth was another term used to describe the Renaissance of intellectual Italians. It was because arts, learning, and literature were reborn after the long and dark Middle Ages, admiring the ancient world of Rome and Greece. The Italians suggested that hundreds of years of cultural darkness were due to the fact that much of the ancient world of learning and literature had gone astray, this cultural darkness occurred in the Middle Ages. It was the Italian humanists who invented the concept of the "Middle Ages" to describe the years between 400 and 1400th century.
</p>

 <p> <br> Northern Europe also began to accept that a new age had emerged after the 17th century, as well as the chronological division of ancientness, the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. To do this, Dutchman Desiderius Erasmus and his supporters turned to two ancient sources: the secular learning of ancient Greece and Rome, and the first four centuries of Christianity (Erasmus, 1466-1536, was a humanist who attempted to unite the Christian faith with the ancient world)
 Christianity during that time offered literature, culture, and referring to good morals, while the New Testament and Church Fathers such as Sts. Augustinus and Jerome combined original Christianity with ancient rhetoric (St. Augustine and Saint Jerome were both church fathers)
</p>

<p> <br>
The problem was the barbaric medieval culture that replaced the old rhetoric. Erasmus and his followers devoted their time to restoring good literature, which meant classical Greek and Latin, and good religion. This led to Christianity being cleaned of medieval philosophical irrelevance and priestly abuse.

The French historians Jacob Burckhardt and Jules Michelet mean that during the 14th and 15th centuries people began to discover themselves and the world that was outside.
The typical Renaissance man was a person who questioned himself and followed his own dreams and desires. This led to a burning desire to explore the world, through art, travel and world trade. In this way, Western culture took off and left the oriental and other cultures in the development.

<p> <br> Humanistic and popular writer Petrarch is considered the first important person because he strongly criticized medieval life habits. During the period 1400-1450, many intellectuals agreed with Petrarch's criticism of the Middle Ages and support for the rebirth of ancient culture and the first four centuries of Christianity to be adapted to the new society.
</p>
<p> <br> The result of this led to the creation of humanism, which would later dominate Italian Latin schools, ethical ideas and spread to the rest of Europe in the late 15th and early 1600s.
Monarchies such as Spain, France, and England emerged as powerful and their disputes between each other dominated European politics over the next 150 years. Finally, the spread of books created by Johannes Gutenberg was so great that one could not measure it. By the end of the 14th century, around twenty cities had printing presses, which were later increased to 255 cities in the 15th century. More books for the people influenced them both intellectually and religiously.
