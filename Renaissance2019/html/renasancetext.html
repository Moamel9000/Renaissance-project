<h1> Government and Monarchy the in Renaissance </h1>

<p>In the renaissance a lot happened in the political world. New ideas began to
grow and others started to get unpopular. Politics changed to look more like
what we have today it is probably safe to say that if it wouldn’t have been for
the renaissance politics would not be the same today.<p>

<br>

<h3> Different ideas </h3>

<p>The renaissance had 3 forms of political ideas. The first one is Princedoms,
second one is Monarchy and third is the Republican idea. Princedoms basically
means that everyone has their rank and their place, everyone should know where
they belong. That idea changed later on and became more more like what we have
today, where you can create your own path. At that time monarchies were very
popular. Monarchy is the idea of having a King and Queen and they had that but
they also had democracy, kind of like how it works in Sweden today. They also
had representatives who would represent the people and they worked together on
deciding things like lawmaking and taxation. Some nations were republican which
was popular at the time and still is in some parts of the world.<p>

  <br>

<h3> Changes in politics </h3>

<p>in the renaissance there were major changes in politics. Things that today seem
normal but at the time were relatively new. The most noticeable is the
segregation of politics and religion. Christianity wasn’t seen as a part of
authority and power anymore. The government started caring more about democracy
and humanism than religion. The power stopped being inherited, power stopped
being passed down from the father to his son.
Also people realized that they don’t have to stay in the class they were born in
which led into the caste system becoming suspended. People became more into the
idea of humanism. what it means is basically that people started becoming more
tolerant against other races and different ideas.<p>

<h3> The Italian monarchy </h3>


<p>The period of the Italian monarchy was between the 14th century and 17th
century. Like I mentioned before monarchies in the renaissance states didn’t
mean that the King and Queen had complete power. What they did is that they
worked with representatives who represented the people. They were chosen by the
people. The people voted on who was going to represent them and it was not just
one person they voted on a group. That system looks a lot like ours today, it
is called representative democracy.<p>
