<h1> Government and Monarchy the in Renaissance </h1>

In the renaissance a lot happened in the political world. New ideas began to
grow and others started to get unpopular. Politics changed to look more like
what we have today it is probably safe to say that if it wouldn’t have been for
the renaissance politics would not be the same today.

<br>

<h3> Different ideas </h3>

The renaissance had 3 forms of political ideas. The first one is Princedoms,
second one is Monarchy and third is the Republican idea. Princedoms basically
means that everyone has their rank and their place, everyone should know where
they belong. That idea changed later on and became more more like what we have
today, where you can create your own path. At that time monarchies were very
popular. Monarchy is the idea of having a King and Queen and they had that but
they also had democracy, kind of like how it works in Sweden today. They also
had representatives who would represent the people and they worked together on 
deciding things like lawmaking and taxation. Some nations were republican which
was popular at the time and still is in some parts of the world.
