      <h3> The Catholic Church  </h3> <br>
      Catholicism dominated Europe during the middle ages. After the split of the Roman Empire, the Catholic Church was one of the main factors of connection amongst the population. Another reason behind the rapid gain of power for the church was that the pope, in Rome, had the advantage to decide if a person went to hell or paradise after death. This resulted in that almost everyone, from farmers to leaders, dedicated the majority of their possession and life to the organisation. For instance people in Rome were obligated to pay ten percent rent to the pope.

      The fear and paranoia of not having a peaceful afterlife continued and people followed the church’s teachings about moral and ethics strictly. Their view on life however was more material rather than spiritual. Because only the church had authority over the education, science was not a well-comprehended concept. Those who dared to challenge what they had learnt and spoke negatively about it, were labelled as heretics and got banned.

      <h3> The Reformation </h3> <br>
      In the beginning of the 16th century, a young German monk named Martin Luther, questioned the Catholic Church.

A person’s belief in God and the religion should have been crucial, the material sacrifice. Numerous of German leaders agreed with Luther, mainly because they wanted to regain the power over the church again. Utilizing the new extraordinary art of printing, the monk’s theory spread like fire amongst the townspeople and the European population.

      This incident was soon to be called the Reformation and resulted in West Europe dividing in half. One half still being Catholic and the other developing a new Christian alignment called Protestantism. During the great cultural and social change, new and innovative ways of thinking made it possible for people to think independently as individuals. The Renaissance and Reformation fostered a rise in humanism and secularism which would help form our modern society.
